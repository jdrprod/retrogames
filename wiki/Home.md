### Welcome to the Retrogames Programming Project

In this project, you will improve your Python programming skills
through the creation of games from the eighties. We will program three
_retrogames_ of increasing complexity.

The only prerequisites is some basic knowledge of the Python
programming language. Absolute Python beginners should first spend
some time on [[the PLM|http://webloria.loria.fr/~quinson/PLM/]], which
is an online learning environment to learn the basics of
programming. Some missions of the PLM could reveal interesting and
challenging to intermediate and advanced learners too ;)

You also need a working environment with Python3 and [a decent code
editor](A-decent-code-editor). You can choose to use whichever
environment you want, but I will only be able to [help you with
Linux](Installing-Python3-on-Linux) questions as it is the only
systems that I really know. It does NOT mean that you have to install
Linux for that assignment.


When you are ready, proceed to your first game creation: [[Scratch the rocket]].
