Retrogames for beginners
========================

This is a set of lessons to learn programming in Python through the 
creation of several retrogames (ie, remake of games from the 80ies). 
In the last lesson, you will recreate the 
[OIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oids) game. 

To start now, just proceed to the [first
lesson](https://github.com/mquinson/retrogames/blob/master/retrogames.org).

You will use excellent game engine authored by John Aycock, that you
can retrieve from the [author's web
page](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/) (in tab Papers), or
directly by following [this 
link](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~aycock/engine.tar.gz). For more 
information about the engine, you should read the following paper, 
available from the above web page.
