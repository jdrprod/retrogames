Welcome to the Retrogames Programming Project
=============================================


In this project, you will improve your Python programming skills
through the creation of games from the eighties. We will program three
*retrogames* of increasing complexity.

The only prerequisites is some basic knowledge of the Python
programming language. Python beginners should first spend some time on
`the PLM <http://people.irisa.fr/Martin.Quinson/Teaching/PLM/>`_,
which is an integrated learning environment dedicated to
programming. Some of the proposed missions will challenge intermediate
and advanced learners too ;)

You also need a working environment with Python3 and
:ref:`a decent code editor <code-editor>`.
You can choose to use whichever environment you want, but I will only
be able to :ref:`help you with Linux <Installing-Python3-on-Linux.rst>`
questions as it is the only systems that I really know. It does NOT
mean that you have to install Linux for that assignment.

When you are ready, **proceed to your first game creation**:
:ref:`Scratch the rocket<Scratch-the-rocket>`.
